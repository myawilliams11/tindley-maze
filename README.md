# Maze

In this application, you'll be making a maze game where you have to get Chok
from the starting square to the finish square.

## Quick Start
1. Checkout the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com:KenzieAcademy/kenzie-maze.git
```
2. Open "maze.js" and scroll to "START HERE", then start coding!

You may also wish to look at the other code to get a grasp of how the game
works as a whole, but I suggest doing so after you've taken a look at "START
HERE" first.

## Difficulty Levels

There are 4 difficulties:
- easy
- medium
- hard
- extra-hard

Easy is the default. If you complete it and would like to try another
difficulty, commit your changes and switch to that branch.

The following will save your progress in "easy" mode, and move on to medium:

```bash
git commit -am "I just finished easy level"
git checkout medium
```
